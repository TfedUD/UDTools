Hi. This is the start of a thing, that will hopefully be helpful.
Currently working on a 'core component' do handle 2020 National Cost Estimator Data.
After the 'Core' then:   'call from' and geometric interogation ect.

Why do massing and energy modeling and the likes without a $$ parameter in the mix?
